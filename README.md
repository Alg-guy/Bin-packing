# Bin-packing
Learn python through programming bin packing
You can call it bin packing, knapsacking, cutting stock, 
I have created 3D & 2D bin packing algorithms for many of my clients as a faster and more precise alternative to many of the available solutions as Fastcam's fastcut and sketchcut.
My algorithm proposes a new method to solving the famous problem.
I have made a tutorial and provided snippets of my code here.
