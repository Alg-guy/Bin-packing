# Bin-packing
Learn python through programming bin packing.



You can call it bin packing, knapsacking, cutting stock, 


I have created 3D & 2D bin packing algorithms for many of my clients as a faster and more precise alternative with many features to many of the available solutions as Fastcam fastcut and sketchcut.


My algorithm proposes a new method to solving the famous problem.


These are links for a tutorial and i provided snippets of my code here, in an effort to pass through what i have learned and help as i can easily say that if the opensource community didn't exist, i wouldn't have learned a lot.

More is yet to come
